# 🎨 UI Clones by Sumit

Welcome to my digital playground where I recreate the UIs of famous websites pixel by pixel—because why just admire great design when you can *clone* it like a frontend ninja? 🥷💻

## 🚀 What is this?

A collection of handcrafted UI clones of popular websites.  
No templates. No shortcuts. Just me, my keyboard, and a suspicious amount of coffee ☕.

## 🧠 Why?

- To sharpen my frontend skills 🔪
- To reverse-engineer design logic 🧩
- To flex a little (okay, a lot) 💪
- Because cloning is legal when it’s just pixels 😎

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 (the bones 🦴)
- CSS3 (the drip 💅)
- JavaScript (the spice 🌶️)
- Occasionally Tailwind or Bootstrap (when I feel lazy 🤫)
